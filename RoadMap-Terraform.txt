******************************************************** Terraform Basic ********************************************************

Terraform is an open-source tool used for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure. Automate the deployment with the use of a Terraform config file.

Terraform workflow: 

1. First, we need a Terraform config file that defines the components of our Azure infrastructure.

2. terrafern init—This is used to initialize the working directory that contains the Terraform configuration files.

3. terraform plan—Here Terraform will create an execution plan. Here you can see what changes Terraform is going to make to your infrastructure based on the configuration file. ()

4. terraform apply—This will execute the actions in the Terraform plan.

5. terraform destroy—This will destroy your infrastructure objects based on the Terraform configuration.

The application object (App Registration) is used to connect Terraform to Azure.
